# JPG-Rename-From-Meta

A short script that renames JPG-files from the metadata. Just run the script and paste in the path to the folder with the images. The files will be renamed so they are sorted chronologically based on when they were taken. Example
`20231171_093437_af45.jpg`. First is the year, month and date followed by the time of day. Added a random hex value at the end in case on the rare occasion two images should have the same timestamp.
